One of the most pressing problems nowadays is the provenance of food and food-related products that citizens consume, mainly due to several food scares and the globalization of food markets, which has resulted in food supply chains that extend beyond nations or even continent boundaries. Food supply networks are characterized by high complexity and a lack of openness. There is a critical requirement for applying novel techniques to verify and authenticate the origin, quality parameters, and transfer/storage details associated with food. This study portrays an end-to-end approach to enhance the security of the food supply chain and thus increase the trustfulness of the food industry. The system aims at increasing the transparency of food supply chain monitoring systems through securing all components that those consist of. A universal information monitoring scheme based on blockchain technology ensures the integrity of collected data, a self-sovereign identity approach for all supply chain actors ensures the minimization of single points of failure, and finally, a security mechanism, that is based on the use of TinyML’s nascent technology, is embedded in monitoring devices to mitigate a significant portion of malicious behavior from actors in the supply chain. © 2022 by the authors.

Deep learning techniques for motion control have recently taken a major qualitative step since vision-based inference tasks can be executed directly on edge. The goal is to fully integrate the machine learning (ML) element into small UAVs. However, given the limited payload capacity and energy available on small UAVs, integrating computing resources sufficient to host ML and vehicle control functions is still challenging. This paper presents a modular and generic system that can control the UAV by evaluating vision-based ML tasks directly inside the resource-constrained UAV. Two different vision-based navigation configurations were tested and demonstrated. The first configuration implements an autonomous landing site detection system, tested with two models based on LeNet-5 and MobileNetV2, respectively. This allows the UAV to change its planned path accordingly and approach the target to land. Moreover, a model for people detection based on a custom MobileNetV2 network was evaluated in the second configuration. Finally, the execution time and power consumption were measured and compared with a cloud computing approach. The results show the ability of the developed system to dynamically react to the environment to provide the necessary maneuver after detecting the target exploiting only the constrained computational resources of the UAV controller. Furthermore, we demonstrated that moving to the edge, instead of using cloud computing inference, decreases the energy requirement of the system without reducing the quality of service. © 2022 Elsevier Inc.","Deep Neural Networks; Edge inference; Sustainable computing; UAV; Visual navigation","Aircraft control; Aircraft detection; Antennas; Control system synthesis; Deep neural networks; Edge computing; Low power electronics; Quality of service; Cloud-computing; Computing platform; Dynamic environments; Edge computing; Edge inference; Low Power; Small unmanned aerial vehicles; Sustainable computing; Vision based; Visual Navigation; Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV)",,,,,"2018-2022","All authors approved the version of the manuscript to be published.

However, the state-of-the-art offline training algorithms for DSNNs are facing two major challenges. Firstly, many timesteps are required to reach comparable accuracy with traditional frame-based DNNs algorithms. Secondly, extensive memory requirements for weight storage make it impossible to store all the weights on-chip for DSNNs with many layers. Thus the inference process requires continue access to expensive off-chip memory, ultimately leading to performance degradation in terms of throughput and power consumption. In this work, we propose a hardware-friendly training approach for DSNN that allows the weights to be constrained to ternary format, hence reducing the memory footprints and the energy consumption. Software simulations on MNIST and CIFAR10 datasets have shown that our training approach could reach an accuracy of 97% for MNIST (3-layer fully connected networks) and 89.71% for CIFAR10 (VGG16). To demonstrate the energy efficiency of our approach, we have proposed a neural processing module to implement our trained DSNN. When implemented as a fixed, 3-layers fully-connected system, the system has reached at energy efficiency of 74nJ/image with a classification accuracy of 97% for MNIST dataset. We have also considered a scalable design to support more complex network topologies when we integrate the neural processing module with a 3D Network-on-Chip. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.","Deep Spiking Neural Network; Hardware implementation; Neuromorphic; Ternary-weight quantization","Classification (of information); Complex networks; Deep neural networks; Energy utilization; Low power electronics; Network-on-chip; Speech recognition; Deep spiking neural network; Hardware implementations; Low Power; Neural-networks; Neural-processing; Neuromorphic; On chips; Processing modules; Quantisation; Ternary-weight quantization; Energy efficiency",,,,,"Đại học Quốc gia Hà Nội, ĐHQGHN","This work is partly supported by Vietnam National University, Hanoi (VNU) through research project “Investigate and develop a secure IoT platform” (Secu-IoT).",,"Krizhevsky, A., Sutskever, I., Hinton, G.E., ImageNet classification with deep convolutional neural networks (2012), 1, pp. 1097-1105. , Proceedings Of The 25th International Conference On Neural Information Processing Systems, NIPS’12; Simonyan, K., Zisserman, A., Very deep convolutional networks for large-scale image recognition (2015), International Conference On Learning Representations; He, K., Zhang, X., Ren, S., Sun, J., Deep residual learning for image recognition (2016), pp. 770-778. , Proceedings Of The IEEE Conference On Computer Vision And Pattern Recognition; Redmon, J., Divvala, S., Girshick, R., Farhadi, A., You only look once: Unified, real-time object detection (2016), pp. 779-788. , Proceedings Of The IEEE Conference On Computer Vision And Pattern Recognition; Liu, W., Anguelov, D., Erhan, D., Szegedy, C., Reed, S., Fu, C.-Y., Berg, A.C., Ssd: Single shot multibox detector (2016) European Conference On Computer Vision, pp. 21-37. , Springer; Lample, G., Ballesteros, M., Subramanian, S., Kawakami, K., Dyer, C., Neural architectures for named entity recognition (2016), arXiv preprint; Hermann, K.M., Kocisky, T., Grefenstette, E., Espeholt, L., Kay, W., Suleyman, M., Blunsom, P., Teaching machines to read and comprehend (2015) Advances In Neural Information Processing Systems, pp. 1693-1701; Zhou, B., Lapedriza, A., Xiao, J., Torralba, A., Oliva, A., Learning deep features for scene recognition using places database (2014) Advances In Neural Information Processing Systems, pp. 487-495; Jouppi, N.P., Young, C., Patil, N., Patterson, D., Agrawal, G., Bajwa, R., Bates, S., Yoon, D.H., In-datacenter performance analysis of a tensor processing unit (2017) Proceedings Of The 44th Annual International Symposium On Computer Architecture, ISCA ’17, pp. 1-12. , ACM New York, NY, USA; Chen, Y.H., Krishna, T., Emer, J.S., Sze, V., Eyeriss: An energy-efficient reconfigurable accelerator for deep convolutional neural networks (2017) IEEE J.

These cues assist people in understanding and inferring the hidden emotional state of the individuals. However, blind and visually impaired persons (VIPs) sadly lack access to such cues, which results in impaired interpersonal communication. To alleviate the issue, in this research, we present a proof-of-concept (POC) implementation of a deep learning-inspired vision-based low-cost intelligent embedded system for the haptic rendering of facial emotions to the VIPs. To this end, a novel lightweight shallow convolutional neural network (CNN) has been designed, optimized, and implemented on a resource-constrained embedded platform for the real-time analysis of facial emotions in static images. We evaluated the model on five benchmark FER datasets, namely CK+, RaFD, SFEW, FER2013, and RAF. Also, for real-time performance, the trained CNN is optimized using TensorRT SDK and deployed on the Nvidia Jetson TX2 embedded platform. Comparative analysis results with state-of-the-art FER techniques confirm the efficacy of the designed CNN that achieves competitive recognition accuracy and runs in real-time at a frame processing speed of 40 fps on the Jetson TX2 embedded device. Finally, the embedded FER platform is integrated with a low-cost and user-friendly haptic device to render emotions to the VIPs in the form of vibration cues.

The traditional classification method mainly relies on the user’s manual marking, but the accuracy of automatic classification has some defects. With the development of convolutional neural network(CNN), the design of lightweight neural network has become a hot topic. However, the state-of-the-art studies always sacrifice classification accuracy for network lightweight, which greatly frustrates usability. In this paper, a new neural network framework, named MobVi, is proposed to enhance the precision of lightweight neural network by solution space division. MobVi is including image solution space division and judgment class. The former uses clustering method based on deep learning to distinguish which small solution space the image belongs to, while the latter uses lightweight neural network customized for the solution space to judge the class. In order to reduce the amount of model parameters and calculations, we designed a customized CNN module. Finally, we propose an energy prediction model to measure whether the model can be successfully implemented on mobile devices. A series of experiments have proved that MobVi has better performance than most existing models for mobile devices. Our model achieves 83.5% accuracy on CIFAR-10 data set, and the parameter quantity is only 2.0 M. © 2021, China Computer Federation (CCF).","Convolutional neural network; Image classification; Mobile devices; Solution space division",,,,,,"2020KW-004; China Postdoctoral Science Foundation: 2017M613187; Shaanxi Key Science and Technology Innovation Team Project: 2018TD-026; Key Research and Development Projects of Shaanxi Province: 2018SF-369","This work was supported in part by International Cooperation Project of Shaanxi Province (No. 2020KW-004), the China Postdoctoral Science Foundation (No. 2017M613187), the Key Research and Development Project of Shaanxi Province (No. 2018SF-369), and the Shaanxi Science and Technology Innovation Team Support Project under grant agreement (No. 2018TD-026).",,"Alaziz, M., Jia, Z., Howard, R.E., Lin, X., Zhang, Y., In-bed body motion detection and classification system (2020) ACM Trans.

However, existing methods often ignore the temporal correlations of physical layer parameter series and rarely consider the influence of link fluctuations, which lead to more errors under moderate and sudden changed links with larger fluctuations. In view of these problems, this paper proposes a more effective link quality prediction method RNNLQI, which adopts Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) to predict the Link Quality Indicator (LQI) series, and then evaluates the link quality according to the fitting model of LQI and PRR. This method accurately mines the inner relationship among LQI series with the help of short-term memory characteristics of RNN and effectively deals with link fluctuations by taking advantage of the higher resolution of LQI in the transitional region. Compared with similar methods, RNN-LQI proves to be better under different link qualities. Especially under moderate and sudden changed links with larger fluctuations, the prediction error reduces at least by 14.51% and 13.37%, respectively. Therefore, the proposed method is more suitable for low power wireless links with more fluctuations. © 2022 by the authors.

By analyzing the role and performance of each block in the original multi-objects tracking system, the blocks of the original system are reconstructed to enhance the efficiency and yield a faster processing speed suiting the real-time applications. In the proposed method, the first two parts of the multi-object tracking system are merged into a single neural network designed for object detection and feature extraction. A new object association judgment method and JDE inspired prediction head are included in order to achieve a better and an outstanding association effect resulting in the overall improvement of the original system by 45.2%. The enhanced method is aimed at the application of smart roadside units and uses fixed-viewpoint image input to achieve multi-object tracking on embedded platforms. The proposed method is implemented on the NVIDIA Jetson AGX Xavier embedded platform. The NVIDIA TensorRT software development kit is used to accelerate the neural network. The overall performance of the proposed system yields better efficiency compared to that of the original SDE design and the overall computing performance achieve up to 14-26 images per second, making it ideal for the real-time smart roadside unit applications. © 2013 IEEE.","Advanced driver assistance system (ADAS); Embedded system; Multiple object tracking; Smart transportation","Advanced driver assistance systems; Automobile drivers; Deep learning; Efficiency; Embedded systems; Extraction; Image enhancement; Object detection; Object recognition; Real time systems; Software design; Advanced driver assistance system; Computational modelling; Embedded-system; Features extraction; Multi-object tracking; Multiple object tracking; Object Tracking; Real - Time system; Smart transportation; Targets tracking; Feature extraction",,,,,,,,"Rodrigue, J.-P., Comtois, C., Slack, B., (2020) The Geography of Transport Systems, 5th ed, p. 456. , New York, NY, USA: Routledge; (2008) OECD/ECMT.

However, current pre-screening solutions are manual and the resultant clinical treatment isn&#x201D;t cost-effective for the average individual, primarily in developing nations. In this paper, we present an automated and inexpensive pre-screening solution utilizing Artificial Intelligence (AI) deployed on embedded edge devices to detect benign and pre-malignant superficial oral tongue lesions. The proposed machine vision solution utilizes a clinically annotated photographic dataset of 9 types of superficial oral tongue lesions to retrain a MobileNetV2 neural network using transfer learning. In this approach we also utilized TensorFlow Lite for Microcontrollers to quantize a 32-bit floating point (float32) precision model into an 8-bit integer (int8) model for deployment on power and resource constrained OpenMV Cam H7 Plus embedded edge device. The quantized int8 model was able to detect the 9 tongue lesions with an accuracy of 98.69% on the test set. More than 60% reduction in on-device RAM and Flash memory usage was measured for the int8 model when compared to the equivalently performing float32 model for relatively the same inference speed (~1.1 msec) on the target edge device.

In this paper, we train the SNN in which the firing time carries information using temporal backpropagation. The temporally encoded SNN with 512 hidden neurons achieved an accuracy of 96.90% for the MNIST test set. Furthermore, the effect of the device variation on the accuracy in temporally encoded SNN is investigated and compared with that of the rate-encoded network. In a hardware configuration of our SNN, NOR-type analog memory having an asymmetric floating gate is used as a synaptic device. In addition, we propose a neuron circuit including a refractory period generator for temporally encoded SNN. The performance of the 2-layer neural network composed of synapses and proposed neurons is evaluated through circuit simulation using SPICE based on the BSIM3v3 model with 0.35~μ m technology. The network with 128 hidden neurons achieved an accuracy of 94.9%, a 0.1% reduction compared to that of the system simulation of the MNIST dataset. Finally, each block's latency and power consumption constituting the temporal network is analyzed and compared with those of the rate-encoded network depending on the total time step. Assuming that the network has 256 total time steps, the temporal network consumes 15.12 times less power than the rate-encoded network and makes decisions 5.68 times faster. © 2013 IEEE.","hardware-based neural networks; Neuromorphic; neuron circuits; spiking neural networks (SNNs); temporal coding; time-to-first-spike (TTFS) coding","Electric power utilization; Encoding (symbols); Low power electronics; Network coding; Neural networks; SPICE; Timing circuits; Biological neural networks; Encodings; Firing; Hardware-based neural network; Neural-networks; Neuromorphic; Neuron circuits; Non-volatile memory; Nonvolatile memory; Performances evaluation; Spiking neural network; Synapse; Temporal coding; Time-to-first-spike coding; Neurons",,,,,"Ministry of Science, ICT and Future Planning, MSIP: 2021M3F3A2A02037889; National Research Foundation of Korea, NRF; National Key Research and Development Program of China, NKRDPC","This work was supported in part by the Brain Korea 21 Plus Project in 2022, and in part by the National Research and Development Program through the National Research Foundation of Korea (NRF) funded by the Ministry of Science and ICT under 2021M3F3A2A02037889.",,"Krizhevsky, A., Sutskever, I., Hinton, G.E., ImageNet classification with deep convolutional neural networks (2012) Proc.

It has been proven that wearing a face mask can help limit the spread of the virus. Despite the enormous efforts of people around the world, there still exists a group of people that wear face masks incorrectly. In order to provide the best level of safety for everyone, face masks must be worn correctly, especially indoors, for example, in shops, cinemas and theaters. As security guards can only handle a limited area of the frequently visited objects, intelligent sensors can be used. In order to mount them on the shelves in the shops or near the cinema cash register queues, they need to be capable of battery operation. This restricts the sensor to be as energy-efficient as possible, in order to prolong the battery life of such devices. The cost is also a factor, as cheaper devices will result in higher accessibility. An interesting and quite novel approach that can answer all these challenges is a TinyML system, that can be defined as a combination of two concepts: Machine Learning (ML) and Internet of Things (IoT). The TinyML approach enables the usage of ML algorithms on boards equipped with low-cost, low-power microcontrollers without sacrificing the classifier quality. The main goal of this paper is to propose a battery-operated TinyML system that can be used for verification whether the face mask is worn properly. To this end, we carefully analyze several ML approaches to find the best method for the considered task. After detailed analysis of computation and memory complexity as well as after some preliminary experiments, we propose to apply the K-means algorithm with carefully designed filters and a sliding window technique, since this method provides high accuracy with the required energy-efficiency for the considered classification problem related to verification of using the face mask. The STM32F411 chip is selected as the best microcontroller for the considered task. Next, we perform wide experiments to verify the proposed ML framework implemented in the selected hardware platform. The obtained results show that the developed ML-system offers satisfactory performance in terms of high accuracy and lower power consumption. It should be underlined that the low-power aspect makes it possible to install the proposed system in places without the access to power, as well as reducing the carbon footprint of AI-focused industry which is not negligible. Our proposed TinyML system solution is able to deliver very high-quality metric values with accuracy, True Positive Ratio (TPR), True Negative Ratio (TNR), precision and recall being over 96% for masked face classification while being able to reach up to 145 days of uptime using a typical 18650 battery with capacity of 2500 mAh and nominal voltage of 3.7 V. The results are obtained using a STM32F411 microcontroller with 100 MHz ARM Cortex M4, which proves that execution of complex computer vision tasks is possible on such low-power devices. It should be noted that the STM32F411 microcontroller draws only 33 mW during operation. © 2022 by the authors.

Deep neural network has achieved great success in computer vision. How to use it at a small size, low cost, low power consumption device with high accuracy and speed on strawberry harvesting machinery has drawn much research attention. Since the infield situation has reduced number of objects and that they are easier to be distinguished from the background compared to other computer vision datasets, the huge neural network structure can be simplified in order to speed up the detection inference without penalizing the detection accuracy. In this research, a new deep neural network called RTSD-Net is proposed based on stat-of-art light-weighted YOLOv4-tiny with reduced layers and modified structure for real-time strawberry detection under infield condition. The original CSPNet was replaced by 2 types of CSPNet designed with reduced parameters and a simplified structure and 4 new network structures are designed by combining these 2 types. The performances of the 4 networks were evaluated. It was observed that the number of parameters of these 4 networks and the detection speed of the model is negatively correlated. Simplified structure and reduced parameters can contribute to faster operational speed. The last one was selected and named as RTSD-Net. Comparing with YOLOv4 tiny, the accuracy of RTSD-Net is only reduced by 0.62% but the speed is increased by 25FPS, which is 25.93% higher than that of YOLOv4-tiny. Embedded system Jetson Nano was selected as the evaluation platform to evaluate the RTSD-Net's performance for edge computing. The original Open Neural Network Exchange (ONNX) model was loaded on Jetson Nano and the speed of RTSD-Net was 13.1FPS, which is 19.0% higher than that of YOLOv4-tiny. After speeded up by TensorRT method, the transformed model reached 25.20fps, which is twice as fast as the ONNX model, and 15% faster than the YOLOv4-tiny model. After speeding up, the efficiency of RTSD-Net is enough for computer vision based strawberry detection and harvesting. In summary, the proposed RTSD-Net has good potential in smart strawberry harvesting machinery and the idea of redesigning neural structure and reducing parameters to speed up the detection rate of deep neural network is expected to have good application in edge computing. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.","Deep learning; Edge computing; Object detection; YOLO","Computer vision; Deep neural networks; Edge computing; Embedded systems; Harvesting; Multilayer neural networks; Object detection; Object recognition; Speed; AI applications; Deep learning; Edge computing; Embedded-system; Exchange models; Neural-networks; Performance; Real- time; Speed up; YOLO; Fruits; artificial neural network; computer vision; detection method; machinery; real time; research work; Fragaria x ananassa",,,,,"National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC: 61905219","This research was funded by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC), grant number: 61905219.",,"Aguiar, A., Santos, F., Santos, L., Filipe, V., Sousa, A., Vineyard trunk detection using deep learning – An experimental device benchmark (2020) Comput.

They offer a sustainable and efficient way of getting around in urban environments, however, these devices bring additional safety issues, including serious accidents for riders. Thereby, taking advantage of a connected personal mobility vehicle, we present a novel on-device Machine Learning (ML)-based fall detection system that analyzes data captured from a range of sensors integrated on an on-board unit (OBU) prototype. Given the typical processing limitations of these elements, we exploit the potential of the TinyML paradigm, which enables embedding powerfulML algorithms in constrained units. We have generated and publicly released a large dataset, including real riding measurements and realistically simulated falling events, which has been employed to produce different TinyML models. The attained results show the good operation of the system to detect falls efficiently using embedded OBUs. The considered algorithms have been successfully tested on mass-market low-power units, implying reduced energy consumption, flash footprints and running times, enabling new possibilities for this kind of vehicles. © 2022 Tech Science Press.

Regarding the process variations in the memristors and the sensitivity of the memristive crossbar structure to these fluctuations, the read operation with repetitive pulses and feedback-based write in the memristors are used to implement the neural networks trained by the ex-situ method. Moreover, accurate modeling of the neuron circuit (CMOS inverter) and decreasing the mismatch between trained weights and the limited memristances fill the gap between simulation and implementation. To employ physical constraints based on the memristor framework during the training phase, a linear function is utilized to map the trained weights to the acceptable range of memristances after the training phase. To solve the vanishing gradient problem due to the use of the tanh function as an activation function and for better learning of the network, some measures are taken. Moreover, fin field-effect transistor (FinFET) technology is used to prevent the reduction of the accuracy of the inverter-based memristive neural networks due to the process variations. Overall, our implementation improves the speed, area, power-delay product (PDP), and mean square error (MSE) of the training stage by 91.43%, 95.06%, 48.29% and 81.64%, respectively. © 2021 World Scientific Publishing Company.","ex-situ training; inverter-based neuron; Memristor; process variations","CMOS integrated circuits; Electric inverters; Low power electronics; Mean square error; Memristors; Metals; MOS devices; Oxide semiconductors; Sensitivity analysis; Activation functions; Complementary metal oxide semiconductors; Cross-bar structures; High-precision models; Low power inverter; Physical constraints; Power delay product; Vanishing gradient; Neural networks",,,,,,,,"Chen, B., Cai, F., Zhou, J., Ma, W., Sheridan, P., Lu, W.

Therefore, in this study, we propose a deep learning framework that is specialized for embedded systems with limited resources, the operation processing structure of which differs from that of standard PCs. The proposed framework supports an OpenCL-based accelerator engine for accelerator deep learning operations in various embedded systems. Moreover, the parallel processing performance of OpenCL is maximized through an OpenCL kernel that is optimized for embedded GPUs, and the structural characteristics of embedded systems, such as unified memory. Furthermore, an on-device optimizer for optimizing the performance in on-device environments, and model con-verters for compatibility with conventional frameworks, are provided. The results of a performance evaluation show that the proposed on-device framework outperformed conventional methods. © 2021 by the authors.

UAVs can accomplish complex or dangerous tasks in a reliable and cost-effective way but are still limited by power consumption problems, which pose serious constraints on the flight duration and completion of energy-demanding tasks. The possibility of providing UAVs with advanced decision-making capabilities in an energy-effective way would be extremely beneficial. In this paper, we propose a practical solution to this problem that exploits deep learning on the edge. The developed system integrates an OpenMV microcontroller into a DJI Tello Micro Aerial Vehicle (MAV). The microcontroller hosts a set of machine learning-enabled inference tools that cooperate to control the navigation of the drone and complete a given mission objective. The goal of this approach is to leverage the new opportunistic features of TinyML through OpenMV including offline inference, low latency, energy efficiency, and data security. The approach is successfully validated on a practical application consisting of the onboard detection of people wearing protection masks in a crowded environment. © 2021 by the authors.

Although most edge devices have limited resources, time and energy costs are important when running TinyML applications. In this paper, we propose a structure in which the part that preprocesses externally input data in the TinyML application is distributed to the hardware. These processes are performed using software in the microcontroller unit of an edge device. Furthermore, resistor–transistor logic, which perform not only windowing using the Hann function, but also acquire audio raw data, is added to the inter-integrated circuit sound module that collects audio data in the voice-recognition application. As a result of the experiment, the windowing function was excluded from the TinyML application of the embedded board. When the length of the hardware-implemented Hann window is 80 and the quantization degree is 2−5, the exclusion causes a decrease in the execution time of the front-end function and energy consumption by 8.06% and 3.27%, respectively. © 2021 by the authors.

Therefore it requires a very thoughtful balancing between highly accurate results and the reduction of the allocated physical resources. Deep Learning models provide the highest accuracies, however their typical computational complexity and memory requirements are not easily deployable in handheld or wearable devices which embody very constrained memory and computation capabilities. In this work, we introduce a new HAR system built with a new Hybrid Binarized Neural Network suitable for a very compact and ultra low-power hardware implementation. The system receives data from MEMS based inertial sensors and makes the acquisitions independent from the sensor spatial orientation and the gravity acceleration signal. The system has been trained and validated on the PAMAP2 and SHL dataset. In both cases, it achieves accuracies higher than 99% in the best case, with different input sensor configurations. A custom circuit has been implemented, which extensively shares circuitry between the different functional sub-modules of the system to minimize the amount of mapped physical resources. The FPGA implementation on a Xilinx Artix 7 achieves a total power dissipation of 72 mW and occupies 6788 LUTs. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.","Binarized neural networks; FPGA; Human activity recognition; Inertial sensors","Deep learning; Field programmable gate arrays (FPGA); Low power electronics; Pattern recognition; Wearable sensors; Binarized neural network; Hardware implementations; Highly accurate; Human activity recognition; Inertial sensor; Low Power; Lowpower hardware; Neural-networks; Physical resources; Ultra-low power; Inertial navigation systems",,,,,,,,"Lara, O.D., Labrador, M.A., A Survey on Human Activity Recognition using Wearable Sensors (2013) IEEE Commun.

In this paper, a novel design framework fully automated for Edge applications is proposed to perform such a deployment on System-on-Chips. Based on a high-level Python interface that mimics the leading Deep Learning software frameworks, it offers an easy way to implement a hardware-accelerated DNN on an FPGA. To do this, our design methodology covers the three main phases: (a) customization: where the user specifies the optimizations needed on each DNN layer, (b) generation: the framework generates on the Cloud the necessary binaries for both FPGA and software parts, and (c) deployment: the SoC on the Edge receives the resulting files serving to program the FPGA and related Python libraries for user applications. Among the study cases, an optimized DNN for the MNIST database can speed up more than 60× a software version on the ZYNQ 7020 SoC and still consume less than 0.43 W. A comparison with the state-of-the-art frameworks demonstrates that our methodology offers the best trade-off between throughput, power consumption, and system cost. © 2021 by the authors.

Since the proposed SRAM bit cell uses a single bitline for CIM calculation with decoupled read and write operations, it supports a much higher energy efficiency. In addition, to separate read and write operations, the stack structure of the read unit minimizes leakage power consumption. Moreover, the proposed bit cell structure provides better read and write stability due to the isolated read path, write path and greater pull-up ratio. Compared to the state-of-the-art SRAM-CIM, our proposed SRAM-CIM does not require extra transistors for CIM vector-matrix multiplication. We implemented a 16 k (128 × 128) bit cell array for the computation of 128× neurons, and used 64× binary inputs (0 or 1) and 64 × 128 binary weights (−1 or +1) values for the binary neural networks (BNNs). Each row of the bit cell array corresponding to a single neuron consists of a total of 128 cells, 64× cells for dot-product and 64× replicas cells for ADC reference. Additionally, 64× replica cells consist of 32× cells for ADC reference and 32× cells for offset calibration. We used a row-by-row ADC for the quantized outputs of each neuron, which supports 1–7 bits of output for each neuron. The ADC uses the sweeping method using 32× duplicate bit cells, and the sweep cycle is set to 2N−1 + 1, where N is the number of output bits. The simulation is performed at room temperature (27◦C) using 45 nm technology via Synopsys Hspice, and all transistors in bitcells use the minimum size considering the area, power, and speed. The proposed SRAM-CIM has reduced power consumption for vector-matrix multiplication by 99.96% compared to the existing state-of-the-art SRAM-CIM. Furthermore, because of the decoupled reading unit from an internal node of latch, there is no feedback from the reading unit, with read static noise, and margin-free results. © 2021 by the authors.

These applications require meeting performance targets and resilience constraints due to the limited device area and hostile environments for operation. Numerous research articles have proposed the edge AI accelerator for satisfying the applications, but not all include full specifications. Most of them tend to compare the architecture with other existing CPUs, GPUs, or other reference research, which implies that the performance exposé of the articles are not comprehensive. Thus, this work lists the essential specifications of prior art edge AI accelerators and the CGRA accelerators during the past few years to define and evaluate the low power ultra-small edge AI accelerators. The actual performance, implementation, and productized examples of edge AI accelerators are released in this paper. We introduce the evaluation results showing the edge AI accelerator design trend about key performance metrics to guide designers. Last but not least, we give out the prospect of developing edge AI’s existing and future directions and trends, which will involve other technologies for future challenging constraints. © 2021 by the authors.

Insect identification is also one of the most challenging tasks in agricultural image processing. With the aid of machine vision and machine learning, traditional (manual) identification and counting can be automated. To achieve this goal, a particular data acquisition device and an accurate insect recognition algorithm (model) is necessary. In this work, we propose a new embedded system‐based insect trap with an OpenMV Cam H7 microcontroller board, which can be used anywhere in the field without any restrictions (AC power supply, WIFI coverage, human interaction, etc.). In addition, we also propose a deep learning‐based insect‐counting method where we offer solutions for problems such as the “lack of data” and “false insect detection”. By means of the proposed trap and insect‐counting method, spraying (pest swarming) could then be accurately scheduled. © 2021 by the author.

However, the PPG signal is often severely corrupted by motion artifacts. The aim of this paper is to address the human activity recognition (HAR) task directly on the device, implementing a recurrent neural network (RNN) in a low cost, low power microcontroller, ensuring the required performance in terms of accuracy and low complexity. To reach this goal, (i) we first develop an RNN, which integrates PPG and tri-axial accelerometer data, where these data can be used to compensate motion artifacts in PPG in order to accurately detect human activity; (ii) then, we port the RNN to an embedded device, Cloud-JAM L4, based on an STM32 microcontroller, optimizing it to maintain an accuracy of over 95% while requiring modest computational power and memory resources. The experimental results show that such a system can be effectively implemented on a constrained-resource system, allowing the design of a fully autonomous wearable embedded system for human activity recognition and logging. © 2021 by the authors.

In this work, an area and power optimized hardware implementation of a large‐scale SNN for real time IoT applications is presented. The analog Complementary Metal Oxide Semiconductor (CMOS) implementation incorporates neuron and synaptic circuits optimized for area and power consumption. The asynchronous neuronal circuits implemented benefit from higher energy efficiency and higher sensitivity. The proposed synapse circuit based on Binary Exponential Charge Injector (BECI) saves area and power consumption, and provides design scalability for higher resolutions. The SNN model implemented is optimized for 9 × 9 pixel input image and minimum bit‐width weights that can satisfy target accuracy, occupies less area and power consumption. Moreover, the spiking neural network is replicated in full digital implementation for area and power comparisons. The SNN chip integrated from neuron and synapse circuits is capable of pattern recognition. The proposed SNN chip is fabricated using 180 nm CMOS process, which occupies a 3.6 mm2 chip core area, and achieves a classification accuracy of 94.66% for the MNIST dataset. The proposed SNN chip consumes an average power of 1.06 mW—20 times lower than the digital implementation. © 2021 by the authors.

In addition, the ability to recognize the current state of product quality in real-time is an important prerequisite for autonomous and self-improving manufacturing systems. To address these needs, this study investigates a novel ensemble deep learning architecture based on convolutional neural networks (CNN), gated recurrent units (GRU) combined with high-performance classification algorithms such as k-nearest neighbors (kNN) and support vector machines (SVM). The architecture uses spatio-temporal features extracted from infrared image sequences to locate critical welding defects including lack of fusion (false friends), sagging, lack of penetration, and geometric deviations of the weld seam. In order to evaluate the proposed architecture, this study investigates a comprehensive scheme based on classical machine learning methods using manual feature extraction and state-of-the-art deep learning algorithms. Optimal hyperparameters for each algorithm are determined by an extensive grid search. Additional work is conducted to investigate the significance of various geometrical, statistical and spatio-temporal features extracted from the keyhole and weld pool regions. The proposed method is finally validated on previously unknown welding trials, achieving the highest detection rates and the most robust weld defect recognition among all classification methods investigated in this work. Ultimately, the ensemble deep neural network is implemented and optimized to operate on low-power embedded computing devices with low latency (1.1 ms), demonstrating sufficient performance for real-time applications. © 2021 by the authors.

This scenario brings about the need for effective data compression algorithms to make the data manageable among tiny and battery-powered devices and, more importantly, shareable across the network. Additionally, considering that, very often, wireless communications (e.g., low-power wide-area networks) are adopted to connect field devices, user payload compression can also provide benefits derived from better spectrum usage, which in turn can result in advantages for high-density application scenarios. As a result of this increase in the number of connected devices, a new concept has emerged, called TinyML. It enables the use of machine learning on tiny, computationally restrained devices. This allows intelligent devices to analyze and interpret data locally and in real time. Therefore, this work presents a new data compression solution (algorithm) for the IoT that leverages the TinyML perspective. The new approach is called the Tiny Anomaly Compressor (TAC) and is based on data eccentricity. TAC does not require previously established mathematical models or any assumptions about the underlying data distribution. In order to test the effectiveness of the proposed solution and validate it, a comparative analysis was performed on two real-world datasets with two other algorithms from the literature (namely Swing Door Trending (SDT) and the Discrete Cosine Transform (DCT)). It was found that the TAC algorithm showed promising results, achieving a maximum compression rate of 98.33%. Additionally, it also surpassed the two other models regarding the compression error and peak signal-to-noise ratio in all cases. © 2021 by the authors.

The performance for action recognition has improved, but owing to the complexity of the model, some still limitations to operation in real-time persist. Therefore, a lightweight CNN-based single-stream HAR model that can operate in real-time is proposed. The proposed model extracts spatial feature maps by applying CNN to the images that develop the video and uses the frame change rate of sequential images as time information. Spatial feature maps are weighted-averaged by frame change, transformed into spatiotemporal features, and input into multilayer perceptrons, which have a relatively lower complexity than other HAR models; thus, our method has high utility in a single embedded system connected to CCTV. The results of evaluating action recognition accuracy and data processing speed through challenging action recognition benchmark UCF-101 showed higher action recognition accuracy than the HAR model using long short-term memory with a small amount of video frames and confirmed the real-time operational possibility through fast data processing speed. In addition, the performance of the proposed weighted mean-based HAR model was verified by testing it in Jetson NANO to confirm the possibility of using it in low-cost GPU-based embedded systems. © 2021 by the authors.

We propose a modular design, which can be scaled by the number of inputs (and of corresponding outputs). It is composed of input current–voltage linear converter stages (1st stages), MOSFETs operating in a subthreshold regime implementing the exponential functions (2nd stages), and analog divider stages (3rd stages). Each stage is only composed of p-type MOSFET transistors. Designed in a 0.18 µm CMOS technology (TSMC), the proposed softmax circuit can be operated at a supply voltage of 500 mV. A ten-input/ten-output realization occupies a chip area of 2570 µm2 and consumes only 3 µW of power, representing a very compact and energy-efficient option compared to the corresponding digital implementations. © 2021 by the authors.

Numerous hardware accelerators have been developed to speed up the performance of neural network applications and reduce power consumption; however, most focus on data centers and full-fledged systems. Acceleration in ultra-low-power systems has been only partially addressed. In this article, we present multiPULPly, an accelerator that integrates memristive technologies within standard low-power CMOS technology, to accelerate multiplication in neural network inference on ultra-low-power systems. This accelerator was designated for PULP, an open-source microcontroller system that uses low-power RISC-V processors. Memristors were integrated into the accelerator to enable power consumption only when the memory is active, to continue the task with no context-restoring overhead, and to enable highly parallel analog multiplication. To reduce the energy consumption, we propose novel dataflows that handle common multiplication scenarios and are tailored for our architecture. The accelerator was tested on FPGA and achieved a peak energy efficiency of 19.5 TOPS/W, outperforming state-of-the-art accelerators by 1.5× to 4.5×. © 2021 ACM.","Memristor; mobile neural networks; ultra-low-power architectures","Acceleration; Electric power utilization; Energy efficiency; Energy utilization; Green computing; Low power electronics; Network architecture; Open systems; Analog multiplication; Hardware accelerators; Low-power devices; Microcontroller systems; Network inference; Neural network application; State of the art; Ultra-low power systems; Neural networks",,,,,"Horizon 2020 Framework Programme, H2020: 757259; European Research Council, ERC; United States-Israel Binational Science Foundation, BSF: 2016016","This work was partially supported by the European Research Council under the European Union’s Horizon 2020 Research and Innovation Program (Grant Agreement No. 757259), by the Genpro consortium, Israel Innovation Authority, and by the U.S.-Israel Binational Science Foundation (Grant No. 2016016).

However, scaling autonomous driving to mini-vehicles poses several challenges due to their limited on-board storage and computing capabilities. Moreover, autonomous systems lack robustness when deployed in dynamic environments where the underlying distribution is different from the distribution learned during training. To address these challenges, we propose a closed-loop learning flow for autonomous driving mini-vehicles that includes the target deployment environment in-the-loop. We leverage a family of compact and high-throughput tinyCNNs to control the mini-vehicle that learn by imitating a computer vision algorithm, i.e., the expert, in the target environment. Thus, the tinyCNNs, having only access to an on-board fast-rate linear camera, gain robustness to lighting conditions and improve over time. Moreover, we introduce an online predictor that can choose between different tinyCNN models at runtime—trading accuracy and latency— which minimises the inference’s energy consumption by up to 3.2×. Finally, we leverage GAP8, a parallel ultra-low-power RISC-V-based micro-controller unit (MCU), to meet the real-time inference requirements. When running the family of tinyCNNs, our solution running on GAP8 outperforms any other implementation on the STM32L4 and NXP k64f (traditional single-core MCUs), reducing the latency by over 13× and the energy consumption by 92%. © 2021 by the authors.

Implementations based on both binarized (BIN) and multi-bit (MB) schemes are proposed for DNNs/CNNs. However, there are challenges in accuracy and power efficiency in the practical use of both schemes. This paper proposes a hybrid precision architecture and circuit-level techniques to overcome these challenges. According to measured experimental results, a test chip based on the proposed architecture achieves (1) from binarized weights and inputs up to 8-bit input, 5-bit weight, and 7-bit output, (2) an accuracy loss reduction of from 86% to 96% for multiple complex CNNs, and (3) a power efficiency of 2.15TOPS/W based on a 0.22μm CMOS process which greatly reduces costs compared to digital designs with similar power efficiency. With a more advanced process, the architecture can achieve a higher power efficiency. According to our estimation, a power efficiency of over 20TOPS/W can be achieved with a 55nm CMOS process. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","Computing-In-memory; Neuromorphic computing; Non-volatile memory","CMOS integrated circuits; Digital storage; Efficiency; Low power electronics; Network architecture; Neural networks; Advanced process; Circuit levels; Digital designs; Low-power computing; Non-volatile memory; Power efficiency; Proposed architectures; Ultra low power; Memory architecture",,,,,,,,"Merrikh-Bayat, F., Guo, X., Klachko, M., Prezioso, M., Likharev, K.K., Strukov, D.B., High-performance mixed-signal neurocomputing with nanoscale floating-gate memory cell arrays (2018) IEEE Trans.

This might result in the degradation of the network which could be recognized. Due to the jamming signals, the packet transmission might not be proper. These kinds of attacks are destructive in low power and lossy wireless network due to the attributes such as disruption in communication and rapid trench in the batteries. To detect the attack and to perform the secure data transmission, the illegitimate nodes have to be eradicated. Machine learning and deep learning methods are used for network analysis of intrusion detection and security. Hence, the deep learning model is proposed to identify the attacks which result in secured data transmission. Also, the logistic regression is applied to classify the behaviour of the node so that the deviation could be determined. Deep learning is applied so it can adaptively learn the attacks and classify with higher accuracy. It is efficient as it is adaptive in learning and has improved precision. The performance of the model could be proved with simulations by varying the nodes. The secured data transmission could be proved by analysing several metrics such as packet drop rate, normalized routing overhead, and jitter. The packet drop is decreased to 50%, jitter is decreased to 6% and throughput shows a significant increase by 6% when compared with the Dodge-Jam, a lightweight Mitigating Stealthy Jamming Attacks (MJSA) technique. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.","Deep learning; Detection; Jamming attacks; Logistics regression; Security-data transmission; Wireless sensor networks","Data transfer; Denial-of-service attack; Drops; Intrusion detection; Jamming; Jitter; Learning systems; Logistic regression; Low power electronics; Network security; Packet loss; Sensor nodes; Jamming attacks; Jamming signals; Learning methods; Learning models; Normalized routing overheads; Packet drop rates; Packet drops; Packet transmissions; Deep learning",,,,,,,,"Adam, E.E.B., Deep learning based NLP techniques in text to speech synthesis for communication recognition (2020) J Soft Comput Paradigm (JSCP), 2 (4), pp. 209-215; Ashraf, F., Hu, Y.C., Kravets, R.H., Bankrupting the jammer in WSN (2012) Proceedings of the IEEE MASS; Buczak, A.L., Guven, E., A survey of data mining and machine learning methods for cybersecurity intrusion detection (2016) IEEE Commun Surv Tutor, 18 (2); Cagalj, M., Capkun, S., Hubaux, J.-P., Wormhole-based antijamming techniques in sensor networks (2007) IEEE Trans Mob Comput, 6 (1), pp. 100-114; Chiang, S.S., Huang, C.-H., Chang, K.-C., A minimum hop routing protocol for home security systems using wireless sensor networks (2007) Ieeetransconsum Electron, 53 (4); Dâ A Zoro, S., Ekici, E., Palazzo, S., Optimal power allocation and scheduling under jamming attacks (2017) IEEE/ACM Trans Netw, 25 (3), pp. 1310-1323; Dhaya, R., Flawless identification of fusarium oxysporum in tomato plant leaves by machine learning algorithm (2020) J Innov Image Process (JIIP), 2 (4), pp. 194-201; Duraipandian, M., Performance evaluation of routing algorithm for Manet based on the machine learning techniques (2019) J Trends Comput Sci Smart Technol (TCSST), 1 (1), pp. 25-38; Grover, K., Lim, A., Yangnt, Q., Jamming and anti-jamming techniques in wireless networks: A survey (2014) Int J Ad Hoc Ubiquitous Comput, 17 (4); Heo, J., Kim, J.-J., Mitigating stealthy jamming attacks in low-power and lossy wireless networks (2018) J Commun Netw, 20 (2), pp. 219-230; Huang, H., Xiao, S., Meng, X., Xiong, Y., A remote home security system based on wireless sensor network and GSM technology (2010) Proceedings of the NSWCTC; Huang, J.F., Chang, G.-Y., Huang, J.-X., Anti-jamming rendezvous scheme for cognitive radio networks (2017) IEEE Trans Mob Comput, 16 (3), pp. 648-661; Hussain, A., Saqib, N.A., Qamar, U., Zia, M., Mahmood, H., Protocol aware radio frequency jamming in Wi-Fi and commercial wireless networks (2014) J Commun Netw, 16 (4), pp. 397-406; Li, M., Koutsopoulos, I., Poovendran, R., Optimal jamming attack strategies and network defence policies in wireless sensor networks (2010) IEEE Trans Mob Comput, 9 (8), pp. 1119-1133; Lu, Z., Wang, W., Wang, C., Hiding traffic with camouflage: Minimizingmessage delay in the smart grid under jamming (2012) Proceedings of the IEEE INFOCOM; Mpitziopoulos, A., Gavalas, D., Konstantopoulos, C., Pantziou, G., A survey on jamming attacks and countermeasures in WSNs (2009) IEEE Commun Surv Tutor, 11 (4), pp. 42-56; Murugesan, S., Senthil Kumar, T., Priyanka, U.S., Abinaya, K., Towards an approach for improved security in wireless networks (2013) Int J Comput Appl, 1, pp. 9-13; Noubir, G., Lin, G., Low-power DoS attacks in data wireless LANs and countermeasures (2003) Proceedings of the Mobihoc, pp. 29-30; Paek, J., Fast and adaptive mesh access control in low-power and lossy networks (2015) IEEE Internet Things J, 2 (5), pp. 435-444; Park, M.H., Challenge-response based ACK message authentication (2012) Electron Lett, 48 (16), pp. 1021-1023; Ranganathan, G., A study to find facts behind preprocessing on deep learning algorithms (2021) J Innov Image Process (JIIP), 3 (1), pp. 66-74; Rossi, D., Omana, M., Giaffreda, D., Metra, C., Secure communication protocol for wireless sensor networks (2010) Proc.

However, owing to topologies with many hidden layers, Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) have high computational complexity, which makes their deployment difficult in contexts highly constrained by requirements such as performance, real-time processing, or energy efficiency. Numerous hardware/software optimization techniques using GPUs, ASICs, and reconfigurable computing (i.e, FPGAs), have been proposed in the literature. With FPGAs, very specialized architectures have been developed to provide an optimal balance between high-speed and low power. However, when targeting edge computing, user requirements and hardware constraints must be efficiently met. Therefore, in this work, we only focus on reconfigurable embedded systems based on the Xilinx ZYNQ SoC and popular DNNs that can be implemented on Embedded Edge improving performance per watt while maintaining accuracy. In this context, we propose an automated framework for the implementation of hardware-accelerated DNN architectures. This framework provides an end-to-end solution that facilitates the efficient deployment of topologies on FPGAs by combining custom hardware scalability with optimization strategies. Cutting-edge comparisons and experimental results demonstrate that the architectures developed by our framework offer the best compromise between performance, energy consumption, and system costs. For instance, the low power (0.266W) DNN topologies generated for the MNIST database achieved a high throughput of 3,626 FPS. © 2013 IEEE.","Deep learning; edge computing; electronic design automation; FPGA; low power systems","Computer hardware; Costs; Deep learning; Deep neural networks; Edge computing; Embedded systems; Energy efficiency; Energy utilization; Field programmable gate arrays (FPGA); Low power electronics; Multilayer neural networks; Network architecture; Program processors; Reconfigurable architectures; System-on-chip; Topology; User centered design; End-to-end solutions; Hardware constraints; Hardware-accelerated; Improving performance; Optimization strategy; Optimization techniques; Reconfigurable computing; Reconfigurable embedded systems; Integrated circuit design",,,,,,,,"Li, B.-H., Hou, B.-C., Yu, W.-T., Lu, X.-B., Yang, C.-W., Applications of artificial intelligence in intelligent manufacturing: A review (2017) Frontiers Inf.

This task is fundamental in decision-making and involves different internal conditions such as the internal processing system or external conditions such as weather, illumination, and complex backgrounds. At present, several works are focused on the development of algorithms based on deep learning; however, there is no information on a methodology based on descriptive statistical analysis with results from a solid experimental framework, which helps to make decisions to choose the appropriate algorithms and hardware. This work intends to cover that gap. We have implemented some combinations of deep learning models (MobileNet v1 and ResNet50 v1) in a combination of the Single Shot Multibox Detector (SSD) algorithm and the Feature Pyramid Network (FPN) component for TSD in a standardized dataset (LISA), and we have tested it on different hardware architectures (CPU, GPU, TPU, and Embedded System). We propose a methodology and the evaluation method to measure two types of performance. The results show that the use of TPU allows achieving a processing training time 16.3 times faster than GPU and better results in terms of precision detection for one combination. © 2013 IEEE.","autonomous vehicles; computer vision; deep learning; digital systems; embedded systems; hardware acceleration; Traffic sign detection","Accidents; Complex networks; Decision making; Embedded systems; Graphics processing unit; Learning algorithms; Learning systems; Traffic signs; Complex background; External conditions; Feature pyramid; Hardware architecture; Precision detections; Processing systems; Traffic sign detection; Visual perception; Deep learning",,,,,"CETYS Universidad; Consejo Nacional de Ciencia y Tecnología, CONACYT","This work was supported in part by the Coordinación Institucional de Investigación of Centro de Enseñanza Técnica y Superior (CETYS Universidad), and in part by the Consejo Nacional de Ciencia y Tecnología (CONACYT).",,"Liu, W., Wang, Z., Liu, X., Zeng, N., Liu, Y., Alsaadi, F.E., A survey of deep neural network architectures and their applications (2017) Neurocomputing, 234, pp. 11-26. , http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0925231216315533, Apr; Dickmanns, E., Zapp, A., Autonomous high speed road vehicle guidance by computer vision1 (1987) IFAC Proc.

In the fight against pandemic like COVID-19, it is often very difficult for medical staff to carry out venipuncture accurately, since the staff have to wear safety glasses and surgical gloves. In this work, we designed an embedded system which implements deep learning algorithm to localize veins from color skin images. The proposed method consists of a fully convolutional neural network (CNN) as encoder and feature extractor, a dilated convolution module, and a transposed convolution module as decoder. A synchronized RGB/Near Infrared (NIR) image database was constructed to provide the mapping information between the two image fields. A combined loss function which includes a per-pixel loss and a perceptual loss was presented to optimize the network parameters. To make the model adaptive to different images, a histogram specification scheme was adopted to transform the color style of an image. The model was then implemented on a NVIDIA Jetson TX2 development kit. Comprehensive experiments were conducted on different databases to evaluate the proposed method and the embedded system. Experimental results showed that the system has satisfactory performance and a promising perspective in daily medical treatment. © 2013 IEEE.","convolutional neural network; NVIDIA Jetson TX2; Vein localization","Convolution; Convolutional neural networks; Embedded systems; Learning algorithms; Learning systems; Safety glass; Common process; Feature extractor; Histogram specifications; Image database; Loss functions; Mapping information; Medical treatment; Network parameters; Deep learning",,,,,"Ministry of Education, MOE: NJ2020004; Key Research and Development Program of Jiangxi Province: BE2018720","This work was supported in part by the Key Research & Development Programs of Jiangsu Province under Grant BE2018720, and in part by the Open Project of Engineering Center of Ministry of Education under Grant NJ2020004.",,"Huang, C., Clinical features of patients infected with 2019 novel coronavirus in Wuhan, China (2020) Lancet, 395, pp. 497-506. , 10233 Jan; https://www.bing.com/covid/, COVID-19 Epidemic Tracking; Wang, C., Horby, P.W., Hayden, F.G., Gao, G.F., A novel coronavirus outbreak of global health concern (2020) Lancet, 395, pp. 470-473. , Jan. 10233; http://www.ruh.nhs.uk/training/prospectus/clinical_skills/documents/cannulation_and_venepuncture_workbook.doc, The Assessment Strategy for Cannulation and Venipuncture; Jacobson, A.F., Winslow, E.H., Variables influencing intravenous catheter insertion difficulty and failure: An analysis of 339 intravenous catheter insertions (2005) Heart Lung, 34 (5), pp. 345-359. , Sep; Mbamalu, D., Banerjee, A., Methods of obtaining peripheral venous access in difficult situations (1999) Postgraduate Med.

To achieve these desired outcomes, an accurate forward speed prediction model and its successful implementation in a real system is a prerequisite. This paper compares six velocity prediction models based on two types of data-driven models, a Markov chain and a Recurrent Neural Network (RNN), by implementing them in an embedded system to evaluate their prediction accuracy and execution time. The inputs to each model are the driving information acquired on a specific route, such as internal vehicle information, relative speed and distance to the vehicle in the front of the ego-vehicle, and ego-vehicle's location estimated by the GPS signal along with the B-spline roadway model. The proposed prediction models predict the velocity profile of the ego-vehicle up to the prediction horizon of 150 m. The parameters of the proposed models have been optimized using Hyper-parameter Optimization via Radial basis function and Dynamic coordinate search. By applying real driving data, the Markov chain-based models show slightly lower prediction accuracy but shorter execution time than those of the RNN-based models. © 2013 IEEE.","Embedded system; execution time; gated recurrent unit (GRU); long short-term momory (LSTM); Markov chain; prediction accuracy; prediction algorithm; recurrent neural network (RNN)","Embedded systems; Forecasting; Fuel economy; Markov chains; Predictive analytics; Comparative studies; Dynamic coordinates; Hyper-parameter optimizations; Prediction accuracy; Radial basis functions; Recurrent neural network (RNN); Short term prediction; Velocity prediction; Recurrent neural networks",,,,,"Ministry of Trade, Industry and Energy, MOTIE: N0001992; National Research Foundation of Korea, NRF; Ministry of Education, Science and Technology, MEST: 2011-0017495","This work was supported in part by the Industrial Strategy Technology Development Program under Grant 10039673, Grant 10060068, Grant 10079961, and Grant 10080284; in part by the International Collaborative Research and Development Program through the Ministry of Trade, Industry and Energy (MOTIE Korea) under Grant N0001992; and in part by the National Research Foundation of Korea (NRF) grant funded by the Korean Government (MEST) under Grant 2011-0017495.",,"Kumar, K., Parida, M., Katiyar, V.K., Short term traffic flow prediction for a non urban highway using artificial neural network (2013) Procedia Social Behav.

It is difficult to run deep neural networks (DNNs) on these devices, because DNNs perform millions of operations and consume significant amounts of energy. Prior research has shown that a considerable number of a DNN's memory accesses and computation are redundant when performing tasks like image classification. To reduce this redundancy and thereby reduce the energy consumption of DNNs, we introduce the Modular Neural Network Tree architecture. Instead of using one large DNN for the classifier, this architecture uses multiple smaller DNNs (called modules) to progressively classify images into groups of categories based on a novel visual similarity metric. Once a group of categories is selected by a module, another module then continues to distinguish among the similar categories within the selected group. This process is repeated over multiple modules until we are left with a single category. The computation needed to distinguish dissimilar groups is avoided, thus reducing redundant operations, memory accesses, and energy. Experimental results using several image datasets reveal the effectiveness of our proposed solution to reduce memory requirements by 50% to 99%, inference time by 55% to 95%, energy consumption by 52% to 94%, and the number of operations by 15% to 99% when compared with existing DNN architectures, running on two different embedded systems: Raspberry Pi 3 and Raspberry Pi Zero. © 2020 ACM.","image classification; Low-power","Deep neural networks; Embedded systems; Energy utilization; Image classification; Low power electronics; Memory architecture; Network architecture; Battery powered; Embedded device; Hardware resources; Image datasets; Memory access; Memory requirements; Modular neural networks; Visual similarity; Neural networks",,,,,"National Science Foundation, NSF: CNS-1925713, OAC-1535108, OAC-1747694; Intel Corporation; Argonne National Laboratory, ANL; Google","This project was supported in part by NSF OAC-1747694, OAC-1535108, CNS-1925713, Google, Facebook, Intel, and Argonne National Laboratory.

With the advantage of fault feature representation techniques of time–frequency domain for nonstationary signals and the advent of convolutional neural networks (CNNs), bearing fault diagnosis has achieved high accuracy, even at variable rotational speeds. However, the required computation and memory resources of CNN-based fault diagnosis methods render it difficult to be compatible with embedded systems, which are essential in real industrial platforms because of their portability and low costs. This paper proposes a novel approach for establishing a CNN-based process for bearing fault diagnosis on embedded devices using acoustic emission signals, which reduces the computation costs significantly in classifying the bearing faults. A light state-of-the-art CNN model, MobileNet-v2, is established via pruning to optimize the required system resources. The input image size, which significantly affects the consumption of system resources, is decreased by our proposed signal representation method based on the constant-Q nonstationary Gabor transform and signal decomposition adopting ensemble empirical mode decomposition with a CNN-based method for selecting intrinsic mode functions. According to our experimental results, our proposed method can provide the accuracy for bearing faults classification by up to 99.58% with less computation overhead compared to previous deep learning-based fault diagnosis methods. © 2020 by the authors.

Thus, several research studies have been devoted to the development of power models and profilers for embedded systems. Each of these models is designed to fit a specific usage context. This paper is a part of a series of works dedicated to modeling and monitoring embedded systems in airborne equipment. The objective of this paper is twofold. Firstly, it presents an overview of the most used models in the literature. Then, it offers a comparative analysis of these models according to a set of criteria, such as the modeling assumptions, the necessary instrumentation necessary, the accuracy, and the complexity of implementation. Secondly, we introduce a new power estimator for ARM-Based embedded systems, with component-level granularity. The estimator is based on NARX neural networks and used to monitor power for diagnosis purposes. The obtained experimental results highlight the advantages and limitations of the models presented in the literature and demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed NARX, having obtained the best results in its class for a smartphone (An online Mean Absolute Percentage Error = 2.2%). © 2020","Data fitting; Embedded systems; Machine learning; Modeling; NARX; Neural networks; Power consumption; Power profiling; Smartphone","Monitoring; Airborne equipments; Comparative analysis; Comparative studies; Electronic systems; Essential features; Mean absolute percentage error; NARX neural network; Performance analysis; Embedded systems",,,,,,,,"Hoque, M.A., Siekkinen, M., Khan, K.N., Xiao, Y., Tarkoma, S., Modeling, profiling, and debugging the energy consumption of mobile devices (2015) ACM Comput.

Embedded systems are becoming more and more complex and networked, so the real-time performance of embedded systems and the security of network embedded devices face severe challenges. Based on this, this paper studies the real-time task scheduling problem for complex embedded systems and the security of embedded network devices. For real-time, this paper proposes a comprehensive task scheduling algorithm. Based on the task classification in the embedded system, different scheduling methods are adopted for different tasks, and the scheduling mode is flexibly changed as the system load changes. A dynamic integrity measurement model is established based on the star trust chain structure, and the hardware implementation mechanism of constructing dynamic trust chain in embedded system is studied. The dynamic reconfigurable hardware design method based on FPGA is applied to the construction of dynamic trust chain, and a verification system is designed to verify the dynamic measurement mechanism. This can solve the security problem of deep network embedded devices to a certain extent. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","Complex embedded systems; Deep learning; Real-time; Security","Complex networks; Computer hardware; Deep learning; Dynamics; Embedded systems; Hardware security; Learning systems; Multitasking; Real time systems; Reconfigurable hardware; Scheduling; Dynamic measurement; Hardware implementations; Machine learning research; Real time performance; Scheduling methods; Task classification; Task-scheduling algorithms; Verification systems; Network security",,,,,,,,"Magno, M., Ibrahim, A., Pullini, A., An energy efficient E-skin embedded system for real-time tactile data decoding (2018) J.

However, this success comes with the considerable memory and computational costs which make it difficult to deploy these networks directly on resource-constrained embedded systems. To address this problem, we propose TaijiNet, a separable binary network, to reduce the storage and computational overhead while maintaining a comparable accuracy. Furthermore, we also introduce a strategy called partial binarized convolution which binarizes only unimportant kernels to efficiently balance network performance and accuracy. Our approach is evaluated on the CIFAR-10 and ImageNet datasets. The experimental results show that with the proposed TaijiNet, the separable binary versions of AlexNet and ResNet-18 can achieve 26× and 6.4× compression rates with comparable accuracy when comparing with the full-precision versions respectively. In addition, by adjusting the PCA threshold, the xnor version of Taiji-AlexNet improves accuracy by 4-8 percent comparing with other state-of-The-Art methods. © 1968-2012 IEEE.","binarization; Convolutional neural network; embedded systems","Convolution; Deep neural networks; Embedded systems; Binarizations; Compression rates; Computational costs; Computational overheads; Resource-constrained embedded systems; State-of-the-art methods; Convolutional neural networks",,,,,"cstc2019jscx-mbdx0063; National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC: 61601067, 61672116, 61802038; China Postdoctoral Science Foundation: 2017M620412; Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities: 02140 05207005, 2019CDJGFJSJ001; Huxiang Youth Talent Support Program","We would like to thank the anonymous reviewers for their valuable feedback and improvements to this paper.

However, due to its numerous parameters and intensive computation, it is challenging to deploy a CNN model to low-power devices. To solve this problem, we implement a CNN accelerator based on a field-programmable gate array (FPGA), which can accurately and quickly infer the waveform category. By designing the structure of CNN, we significantly reduce its parameters on the premise of high accuracy. Then the CNN is realized on FPGA and optimized by a variety of memory access optimization methods. Experimental results show that our customized CNN has high accuracy and fewer parameters, and the accelerator costs only 0.714 W under a working frequency of 100 MHz, which proves that our proposed solution is feasible. Furthermore, the accelerator classifies the pulse waveform in real time, which could help doctors make the diagnosis. © 2020 by the authors.

Coupled with the need to bring more computation to the edge in resource-constrained embedded and IoT devices, specialized ultra-low power accelerators for spiking neural networks are being developed. Having a large variance in the models employed in these networks, these accelerators need to be flexible, user-configurable, performant and energy efficient. In this paper, we describe CyNAPSE, a fully digital accelerator designed to emulate neural dynamics of diverse spiking networks. Since the use case of our implementation is primarily concerned with energy efficiency, we take a closer look at the factors that could improve its energy consumption. We observe that while majority of its dynamic power consumption can be credited to memory traffic, its on-chip components suffer greatly from static leakage. Given that the event-driven spike processing algorithm is naturally memory-intensive and has a large number of idle processing elements, it makes sense to tackle each of these problems towards a more efficient hardware implementation. With a diverse set of network benchmarks, we incorporate a detailed study of memory patterns that ultimately informs our choice of an application-specific network-adaptive memory management strategy to reduce dynamic power consumption of the chip. Subsequently, we also propose and evaluate a leakage mitigation strategy for runtime control of idle power. Using both the RTL implementation and a software simulation of CyNAPSE, we measure the relative benefits of these undertakings. Results show that our adaptive memory management policy results in up to 22% more reduction in dynamic power consumption compared to conventional policies. The runtime leakage mitigation techniques show that up to 99.92% and at least 14% savings in leakage energy consumption is achievable in CyNAPSE hardware modules. © 2020, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.","Accelerator; Caching; Energy efficiency; Leakage; Memory; Neuromorphic; Reconfigurable; Spiking neural networks","Benchmarking; Computer hardware; Computer software; Electric power utilization; Energy efficiency; Energy utilization; Neural networks; Application-specific network; Computational requirements; Digital accelerators; Dynamic power consumption; Hardware implementations; Neural network model; Processing algorithms; Spiking neural networks; Low power electronics",,,,,"National Science Foundation, NSF;US NSF;USA NSF: CCF-1149539",,,"Akopyan, F., Sawada, J., Cassidy, A., Alvarez-Icaza, R., Arthur, J., Merolla, P., Imam, N., Nam, G.J., Truenorth: Design and tool flow of a 65 mw 1 million neuron programmable neurosynaptic chip (2015) IEEE Transactions on Computer-Aided Design of Integrated Circuits and Systems, 34 (10), pp. 1537-1557; Allu, B., Zhang, W., Static next sub-bank prediction for drowsy instruction cache (2004) Proceedings of the 2004 International Conference on Compilers, Architecture, and Synthesis for Embedded Systems, pp. 124-131. , ACM; Attwell, D., Laughlin, S.B., An energy budget for signaling in the grey matter of the brain (2001) Journal of Cerebral Blood Flow & Metabolism, 21 (10), pp. 1133-1145; Bauer, J., Bershteyn, M., Kaplan, I., Vyedin, P., A reconfigurable logic machine for fast event-driven simulation (1998) Proceedings 1998 Design and Automation Conference. 35Th Dac.(Cat.

This trend has made machine learning algorithms play an increasingly important role. High-performance embedded computing is an effective means to solve the lack of computing power of embedded devices. Aiming at the problem that the calculation amount of new intelligent embedded applications based on machine learning technology is higher, the computing power of traditional embedded systems is difficult to meet their needs, this paper studies the parallel optimization and implementation techniques of convolutional neural networks in Parallella platform. The parallel optimization strategy of convolutional neural network on the clustering architecture processor of heterogeneous multi-core system is given. Then the high-performance implementation of convolutional neural network on Parallella platform is studied, and the function of convolutional neural network system is implemented. A set of performance evaluation methods for embedded parallel processors is proposed. From the application point of S698P, the eCos operating system is selected as the platform. The single-core mode and multi-core mode are compared on the simulator GRSIM, and the parallel performance evaluation is given.

This paves the way for the development of novel applications and services that do not need the omnipresent processing support from the cloud, which is power consuming and involves data security and privacy risks. In this work, a comprehensive review of the novel TinyML ecosystem is provided. The related challenges and opportunities are identified and the potential services that will be enabled by the development of truly smart frugal objects are discussed. As a main contribution of this paper, a detailed survey of the available TinyML frameworks for integrating ML algorithms within MCUs is provided. Besides, aiming at illustrating the given discussion, a real case study is presented. Concretely, we propose a multi-Radio Access Network (RAT) architecture for smart frugal objects. The issue of selecting the most adequate communication interface for sending sporadic messages considering both the status of the device and the characteristics of the data to be sent is addressed. To this end, several TinyML frameworks are evaluated and the performances of a number of ML algorithms embedded in an Arduino Uno board are analyzed. The attained results reveal the validity of the TinyML approach, which successfully enables the integration of techniques such as Neural Networks (NNs), Support Vector Machine (SVM), decision trees, or Random Forest (RF) in frugal objects with constrained hardware resources. The outcomes also show promising results in terms of algorithm's accuracy and computation performance. © 2001-2012 IEEE.",,"Decision trees; Microcontrollers; Security of data; Support vector machines; Communication interface; Computation performance; Data security and privacy; Hardware resources; Microcontroller unit; Multi-radio access; Neural networks (NNS); Novel applications; Radio access networks",,,,,"Ministerio de Ciencia, Innovación y Universidades, MCIU: TIN2017-86885-R; European Commission, EC: 779852, 814918, 830929; European Regional Development Fund, FEDER","This work has been supported by the European Commission, under the projects IoTCrawler (Grant No. 779852), CyberSec4Europe (Grant No. 830929) and Fed4IoT (Grant No. 814918), and by the Spanish Ministry of Science, Innovation and Universities, under the project PERSEIDES (Grant No. TIN2017-86885-R with ERDF funds).",,"Columbus, L., (2018) 10 Charts That Will Change Your Perspective of Big Data's Growth, , https://softwarestrategiesblog.com/2018/06/02/10-charts-that-will-change-your-perspective-of-big-datas-growth, Tech.

It is able to provide long distance wireless communication with great power saving. Given the fact that an LPWAN covers a wide area where all end nodes communicate directly to a few gateways, a large number of devices have to share the gateway. In this situation, chances are many collisions could occur, leading to waste of limited wireless resources. However, many factors affecting the number of collisions that cannot be solved by traditional time series analysis algorithms. Therefore, deep learning methods can be applied here to predict collisions by analyzing these factors in an LPWAN system. In this paper, we propose long short-term memory extended Kalman filter (LSTMEKF) model for collision prediction in the LPWAN in terms of the temporal correlation which can improve the LSTM performance. The efficacies of our models are demonstrated on the data set simulated by LoRaSim. © 2011 KICS.","Deep Learning; extended Kalman filter; Internet of things; LoRa; LSTM","Forecasting; Gateways (computer networks); Industrial internet of things (IIoT); Kalman filters; Learning systems; Long short-term memory; Low power electronics; Time series analysis; Wide area networks; Collision prediction; Data set; Learning methods; Long-distance wireless; Low Power; Power savings; Temporal correlations; Wireless resources; Deep learning",,,,,"Hanyang University, HYU; National Research Foundation of Korea, NRF; Ministry of Science and ICT, South Korea, MSIT","Manuscript received October 22, 2019; revised May 29, 2020; approved for publication by Yansha Deng, Guest Editor, May 31, 2020.

However, this process may require intensive processing load. For this purpose, hybrid object recognition algorithms that can be created for the recognition of an object in the image and the comparison of the working time of these algorithms on various embedded systems are emphasized. While Haar Cascade, Local Binary Pattern (LBP) and Histogram Oriented Gradients (HOG) algorithms are used for object detection, Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and Deep Neural Network (DNN) algorithms are used for classification. As a result, six hybrid structures such as Haar Cascade+CNN, LBP+CNN, HOG+CNN and Haar Cascade+DNN, LBP+DNN, HOG+DNN are developed. In this study, these 6 hybrid algorithms were analyzed in terms of success percentage and time, then compared with each other. Microsoft COCO dataset was used to train and test all these hybrid algorithms. Object recognition success of CNN was 76.33%. Object recognition success of Haar Cascade+CNN, one of the hybrid methods we recommend, with a success rate of 78.6% is higher than CNN and other hybrid methods. LBP+CNN method recognized objects in 0.487 seconds which is faster than any other hybrid methods. In our study, Nvidia Jetson TX2, Asus TinkerBoard, Raspbbery Pi 3 B+ were used as embedded systems. As a result of these tests, Haar Cascade+CNN method on Nvidia Jetson TX2 was detected in 0.1303 seconds, LBP+DNN and Haar Cascade+DNN methods on Asus Tinker Board were detected in 0.2459 seconds, and HOG+DNN method on Raspberry Pi 3 B+ was detected in 0.7153 seconds.. © 2020, Ismail Saritas.

Due to their computational complexity, DNNs benefit from implementations that utilize custom hardware accelerators to meet performance and response time as well as classification accuracy constraints. In this paper, we propose DeepMaker framework that aims to automatically design a set of highly robust DNN architectures for embedded devices as the closest processing unit to the sensors. DeepMaker explores and prunes the design space to find improved neural architectures. Our proposed framework takes advantage of a multi-objective evolutionary approach that exploits a pruned design space inspired by a dense architecture. DeepMaker considers the accuracy along with the network size factor as two objectives to build a highly optimized network fitting with limited computational resource budgets while delivers an acceptable accuracy level. In comparison with the best result on the CIFAR-10 dataset, a generated network by DeepMaker presents up to a 26.4x compression rate while loses only 4% accuracy. Besides, DeepMaker maps the generated CNN on the programmable commodity devices, including ARM Processor, High-Performance CPU, GPU, and FPGA. © 2020","Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs); Design Space Exploration (DSE); Embedded systems; Multi-Objective Optimization (MOO)","Budget control; Embedded systems; Evolutionary algorithms; Integrated circuit design; Multiobjective optimization; Network architecture; Neural networks; Classification accuracy; Compression rates; Computational resources; Convolutional neural network; Custom hardwares; Design space exploration; Multi-objective evolutionary; Neural architectures; Deep neural networks",,,,,,"KKS has supported this work within the projects DeepMaker and DPAC.",,"Krizhevsky, A., Sutskever, I., Hinton, G.E., Imagenet classification with deep convolutional neural networks (2012) Adv.

However, on-device inference on battery-powered, resource-constrained embedding systems is often infeasible due to prohibitively long inferencing time and resource requirements of many DNNs. Offloading computation into the cloud is often unacceptable due to privacy concerns, high latency, or the lack of connectivity. Although compression algorithms often succeed in reducing inferencing times, they come at the cost of reduced accuracy. This article presents a new, alternative approach to enable efficient execution of DNNs on embedded devices. Our approach dynamically determines which DNN to use for a given input by considering the desired accuracy and inference time. It employs machine learning to develop a low-cost predictive model to quickly select a pre-trained DNN to use for a given input and the optimization constraint. We achieve this first by offline training a predictive model and then using the learned model to select a DNN model to use for new, unseen inputs. We apply our approach to two representative DNN domains: image classification and machine translation. We evaluate our approach on a Jetson TX2 embedded deep learning platform and consider a range of influential DNN models including convolutional and recurrent neural networks. For image classification, we achieve a 1.8x reduction in inference time with a 7.52% improvement in accuracy over the most capable single DNN model. For machine translation, we achieve a 1.34x reduction in inference time over the most capable single model with little impact on the quality of translation. © 2020 Copyright held by the owner/author(s).

By using embedded deep learning techniques, the embedded smart school system is designed based on face recognition. For this reason, embedded platforms are used to achieve efficient systems. There is a financial database to identify identity, which find operational risks when choosing a loan. From time to time, someone may send their name to another person on behalf of his / her fake identity for a recommended test. During the work of all financial centers, they are appropriately investigated.

BNN conducts XNOR and bit-counting operations instead of high-precision vector-matrix multiplication (VMM), significantly reducing the memory storage. In this work, an analog bit-counting scheme is proposed to decrease the burden of neuron circuits with a synaptic architecture utilizing NAND flash memory. A novel binary neuron circuit with a double-gate positive feedback (PF) device is demonstrated to replace the sense amplifier, adder, and comparator, thereby reducing the burden of the complementary metal-oxide semiconductor (CMOS) circuits and power consumption. By using the double-gate PF device, the threshold voltage of the neuron circuits can be adaptively matched to the threshold value in the algorithms eliminating the accuracy degradation introduced by the process variation. Thanks to the super-steep SS characteristics of the PF device, the proposed neuron circuit with the PF device has an off-state current of 1 pA, representing 105 times improvement compared to the neuron circuit with a conventional metal-oxide-semiconductor field effect transistor (MOSFET) device. A system simulation of a hardware-based BNN shows that the low-variance conductance distribution (8.4 %) of the synaptic device and the adjustable threshold of the neuron circuit implement a highly efficient BNN with a high inference accuracy. © 2013 IEEE.","hardware neural networks; in-memory computing; NAND flash memory; Neuromorphic; neuron circuits; synaptic device","CMOS integrated circuits; Computer circuits; Dielectric devices; Feedback; Feedback amplifiers; Flash memory; Low power electronics; Memory architecture; Metallic compounds; Metals; MOS devices; NAND circuits; Neurons; Oxide semiconductors; Power MOSFET; Static random access storage; Threshold voltage; Timing circuits; Transistors; Binary neural networks; Complementary metal oxide semiconductors; Conductance distribution; Conventional metals; Off-state current; Process Variation; System simulations; Vector-matrix multiplications; Neural networks",,,,,"National Research Foundation of Korea, NRF: NRF-2016M3A7B4909604","This work was supported in part by the National Research Foundation of Korea under Grant NRF-2016M3A7B4909604, and in part by the Brain Korea 21 Plus Project in 2020.",,"Jackson, B.L., Rajendran, B., Corrado, G.S., Breitwisch, M., Burr, G.W., Cheek, R., Gopalakrishnan, K., Modha, D.S., Nanoscale electronic synapses using phase change devices (2013) ACM J.

For real-time industrial applications, they need to overcome challenges such as high data bandwidth requirement and power consumption on hardware platforms. In this work, we have analyzed in detail the data dependency in the CNN accelerator and propose specific pipelined operations and data organized manner to design a high throughput CNN accelerator on FPGA. Besides, we have optimized the kernel operations to obtain a high power efficiency. The proposed CNN accelerator supports image classification and real-time object detection with high accuracy. The evaluation results show that our CNN-based FPGA accelerator can achieve 740 Giga operations per second (GOPS) at 200 MHz with kernel power of 12.2 watts on Intel Arria 10 FPGA. For object detection tasks, our system can achieve 105 fps with 56.5 mAP or 25 fps with 73.6 mAP on VOC dataset. Since we use the mixed fixed-point data representation, the detection accuracy is comparable with the GPU-based YOLO V2 framework.

Systems-on-Chip (SoC) with Field-programmable Gate Arrays (FPGAs) can be used to improve performance and allow more fine-grain control of resources than CPUs or GPUs, but it is difficult to find the optimal balance between hardware and software to improve DNN efficiency. In the current research literature there have been few proposed solutions to address optimizing hardware and software deployments of DNNs in embedded low-power systems. To address the computation resource restriction and low-power needs for deploying these networks, we describe and implement a domain-specific metric model for optimizing task deployment on differing platforms, hardware and software. Next, we propose a DNN hardware accelerator called Scalable Low-power Accelerator for real-time deep neural Networks (SCALENet) that includes multithreaded software workers. Finally, we propose a heterogeneous aware scheduler that uses the DNN-specific metric models and the SCALENet accelerator to allocate a task to a resource based on solving a numerical cost for a series of domain objectives. To demonstrate the applicability of our contribution, we deploy nine modern deep network architectures, each containing a different number of parameters within the context of two different neural network applications: image processing and biomedical seizure detection. Utilizing the metric modeling techniques integrated into the heterogeneous aware scheduler and the SCALENet accelerator, we demonstrate the ability to meet computational requirements, adapt to multiple architectures, and lower power by providing an optimized task to resource allocation. Our heterogeneous aware scheduler improves power saving by decreasing power consumption by 10% of the total system power, does not affect the accuracy of the networks, and still meets the real-time deadlines. We demonstrate the ability to achieve parity with or exceed the energy efficiency of NVIDIA GPUs when evaluated against Jetson TK1 with embedded GPU SoC and with a 4× power savings in a power envelope of 2.0W. When compared to existing FPGA-based accelerators, SCALENet’s accelerator and heterogeneous aware scheduler achieves a 4.8× improvement in energy efficiency. © 2019 Copyright held by the owner/author(s).","Co-design; FPGA; Hardware; Machine learning; Real-time; Scheduling; Software","Acceleration; Computer hardware; Computer software; Embedded systems; Energy efficiency; Field programmable gate arrays (FPGA); Image processing; Image recognition; Learning algorithms; Learning systems; Low power electronics; Medical applications; Natural language processing systems; Network architecture; Program processors; Programmable logic controllers; Scheduling; System-on-chip; Biomedical applications; Co-designs; Computational requirements; Heterogeneous Scheduling; Multithreaded softwares; NAtural language processing; Neural network application; Real time; Deep neural networks",,,,,,,,"Abtahi, T., Kulkarni, A., Mohsenin, T., Accelerating convolutional neural network with FFT on tiny cores (2017) Proceedings of the IEEE International Symposium on Circuits and Systems (ISCAS’17), pp. 1-4. , https://doi.org/10.1109/ISCAS.2017.8050588; Abtahi, T., Shea, C., Kulkarni, A., Mohsenin, T., Accelerating convolutional neural network with FFT on embedded hardware (2018) IEEE Trans.

However, state-of-the-art GPU hardware platforms are extremely power-hungry, while microprocessors cannot achieve the performance requirements. Biologically-inspired Spiking Neural Networks (SNN) have inherent characteristics that lead to lower power consumption. We thus present a bit-serial SNN-like hardware architecture. By using counters, comparators, and an indexing scheme, the design effectively implements the sum-of-products inherent in neurons. In addition, we experimented with various strength-reduction methods to lower neural network resource usage. The proposed Spiking Hybrid Network (SHiNe), validated on an FPGA, has been found to achieve reasonable performance with a low resource utilization, with some trade-off with respect to hardware throughput and signal representation. © 2019, MDPI AG.

It remains a challenging task to accurately distinguish foreign fibers from cotton. This article proposes an embedded system based on field programmable gate array (FPGA) + digital signal processor (DSP) to recognize and remove foreign fibers mixed in cotton. With substantial tests of this system, we collect massive samples of foreign fibers and fake foreign fibers. Based on these samples, a convolution neural network mode is developed to validate the classification of the suspected targets from the detection subsystem, to improve the detection reliability. After training several model architectures, we find a model with the best balance between performance and computation. The high success rate (up to 96% in the validation set) demonstrates the effectiveness of the model. Moreover, the computation time (5 ms on a single image based on an eight-core DSP) indicates the efficiency of the detection, which ensures the real-time application of the system. © The Author(s) 2019.","Deep learning;

In particular, recent results depict a hopeful prospect for image processing using convolutional neural networks, CNNs, but the gap between software and hardware implementations is already considerable for IoT and mobile edge computing applications due to their high power consumption. This proposal performs low-power and real time deep learning-based multiple object visual tracking implemented on an NVIDIA Jetson TX2 development kit. It includes a camera and wireless connection capability and it is battery powered for mobile and outdoor applications. A collection of representative sequences captured with the on-board camera, dETRUSC video dataset, is used to exemplify the performance of the proposed algorithm and to facilitate benchmarking.

However, DNNs tend to have a large number of learning parameters, leading to a large memory and computation requirement. In this paper, we propose a model compression framework for efficient training and inference of deep neural networks on embedded systems. Our framework provides data structures and kernels for OpenCL-based parallel forward and backward computation in a compressed form. In particular, our method learns sparse representations of parameters using ℓ1-based sparse coding while training, storing them in compressed sparse matrices. Unlike the previous works, our method does not require a pre-trained model as an input and therefore can be more versatile for different application environments. Even though the use of ℓ1-based sparse coding for model compression is not new, we show that it can be far more effective than previously reported when we use proximal point algorithms and the technique of debiasing. Our experiments show that our method can produce minimal learning models suitable for small embedded devices. © 2019 by the authors.","Compressed learning; Debiasing; Embedded systems; OpenCL; Proximal point algorithm; Regularization",,,,,,"Hanyang University, HYU: HY-2017-N","Funding: This work was supported by the research fund of Hanyang University (HY-2017-N).",,"Krizhevsky, A., Sutskever, I., Hinton, G.E., ImageNet Classification with Deep Convolutional Neural Networks (2012) Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems 25, pp. 1097-1105. , Curran Associates, Inc.: New York, NY, USA; Graves, A., Schmidhuber, J., Framewise phoneme classification with bidirectional LSTM and other neural network architectures (2005) Neural Netw, 18, pp. 5-6; Collobert, R., Weston, J., Bottou, L., Karlen, M., Kavukcuoglu, K., Kuksa, P., Natural Language Processing (Almost) from Scratch (2011) J.

This method is applicable to any CNN architecture that operates on signal patterns (e.g., audio, image, video) to extract information such as class membership. It operates on the stack of feature maps in each of the cascading feature matching and pooling layers through the processing hierarchy of the CNN by an explicit competitive process (k-WTA, winner take all) that generates a sparse feature vector at each spatial location. This principle is inspired by local brain circuits, where neurons tuned to respond to different patterns in the incoming signals from an upstream region inhibit each other using interneurons, such that only the ones that are maximally activated survive the quenching threshold. We show this process of sparsification is critical for probabilistic learning of low-precision weights and bias terms, thereby making pattern recognition amenable for energy-efficient hardware implementations. Further, we show that hypercolumn sparsification could lead to more data-efficient learning as well as having an emergent property of significantly pruning down the number of connections in the network. A theoretical account and empirical analysis are provided to understand these effects better. © 2019 Copyright held by the owner/author(s).

The architecture is based on a coarse counter and a couple of two-stage interpolator circuit in order to improve the conversion linearity. The proposed TDC is modeled with the neural network, while the teacher-learner-based optimization algorithm (TLBO) is used to optimize the integral nonlinearity (INL) of the proposed TDC. The proposed optimization method shows a characteristic close to the ideal output of the TDC behavior over a wide input range. Using the achieved results of the TLBO algorithm simulation results using CADENCE VIRTUOSO and standard 180nm CMOS technology shows 1.2s dynamic range, 100ns resolution, 0.19mW power consumption and area of 0.16mm2. The proposed circuit can find application in biomedical engineering systems and other fields where long and accurate time interval measurement is needed. © 2019 World Scientific Publishing Company.","Bio-medical circuit; Neural network; R-r interval measurement; Time interpolator tdc; Time-to-digital converter (tdc); Tlbo; Wide dynamic range","Biomedical engineering; Interpolation; Low power electronics; Neural networks; Signal processing; Teaching; Bio-medical; RR intervals; time interpolator TDC; Time to digital converters; TLBO; Wide dynamic range; Frequency converters",,,,,,,,"Ko, C.-T., Punn, K.-P., Gothenberg, A., A 5-ps vernIer sub-rangIng tIme-to-dIgItal converter with dnl calIbratIon (2015) MIcroelectron.

With the Mecanum vehicle's dynamic model, the FA with hypermutation is fused with RBFNN to develop a real-time optimal controller of the four-wheeled Mecanum vehicles in a field-programmable gate array (FPGA) chip. This hybrid metaheuristics takes the benefits of neural network, FA, real-time control, and FPGA realization. All the FA-RBFNN, dynamic controller, and hardware circuits are implemented in one FPGA chip using System-on-a-Programmable Chip methodology. Comparative works and experimental results clearly illustrate that the proposed FPGA-based FA-RBFNN optimal controller outperforms the conventional control methods. © 2005-2012 IEEE.","Metaheuristic; neural network; optimization; redundant control","Artificial intelligence; Bioluminescence; Controllers; Embedded systems; Field programmable gate arrays (FPGA); Functions; Hybrid vehicles; Intelligent robots; Intelligent vehicle highway systems; Logic gates; Mobile robots; Mobile telecommunication systems; Neural networks; Radial basis function networks; Real time control; Signal receivers; Metaheuristic; Mobile communications; Radial basis function neural networks; Redundant controllers; Redundant controls; Service robots; System on a programmable chips; Traditional approaches; Optimization",,,,,,,,"Tsai, C.C., Huang, H.C., Lin, S.C., FPGA-based parallel DNA algorithm for optimal configurations of an omnidirectional mobile service robot performing fire extinguishment (2011) IEEE Trans.

To reduce the power consumption while maintaining the system recognition accuracy, we first perform a bit-width quantization method on the proposed CNN to reduce the data/weight bit width required by the hardware computing unit without reducing the recognition accuracy. Then, we propose an approximate computing architecture for the quantized CNN using voltage-domain analog switching network based multiplication and addition unit. Implementation results show that this accelerator can support 10 keywords real time recognition under different noise types and SNRs, while the power consumption can be significantly reduced to 52 μW. © 2013 IEEE.","approximate computing; bit-width quantization; spotting","Computer architecture; Convolution; Electric power utilization; Green computing; Neural networks; Switching networks; approximate computing; Bit-Width; Computing architecture; Convolutional neural network; Hardware computing; Real time recognition; Recognition accuracy; spotting; Low power electronics",,,,,"National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC: 61404028, 61574033; National Major Science and Technology Projects of China: 2018ZX01031101-005","This work was supported in part by the National Science and Technology Major Project under Grant 2018ZX01031101-005, and in part by the National Natural Science Foundation of China under Grant 61404028 and Grant 61574033.",,"Shah, M., Arunachalam, S., Wang, J., Blaauw, D., Sylvester, D., Kim, H.-S., Seo, J.-S., Chakrabarti, C., A fixed-point neural network architecture for speech applications on resource constrained hardware (2018) J.

Their role comes down to acquiring data and sending it to a more powerful entity, such as an embedded computer or cloud server. There have been attempts to reduce the computational effort related to data processing in order to use edge computing for predictive maintenance. The aim of this paper is to push the boundaries even further by proposing a novel architecture, in which processing is moved to the sensors themselves thanks to decrease of computational complexity given by the usage of compressed recurrent neural networks. A sensor processes data locally, and then wirelessly sends only a single packet with the probability that the machine is working incorrectly. We show that local processing of the data on ultra-low power wireless sensors gives comparable outcomes in terms of accuracy but much better results in terms of energy consumption that transferring of the raw data. The proposed ultra-low power hardware and firmware architecture makes it possible to use sensors powered by harvested energy while maintaining high confidentiality levels of the failure prediction previously offered by more powerful mains-powered computational platforms. © 2013 IEEE.","bearing faults; compressed recurrent neural networks; edge computing; electric motors; induction motors; Internet of Things; IoT; predictive maintenance; RNN; smart sensors; vibration signature","Data handling; Edge computing; Electric motors; Energy utilization; Firmware; Induction motors; Internet of things; Low power electronics; Maintenance; Network architecture; Smart sensors; Bearing fault; Computational effort; Computational platforms; Embedded computers; Failure prediction; Novel architecture; Predictive maintenance; Vibration signature; Recurrent neural networks",,,,,"692519","This work was supported by ECSEL JU (Electronic Component Systems for European Leadership Joint Undertaking) under Grant 692519 – PRIME (Ultra-Low Power Technologies and Memory Architectures for IoT).",,"Sudhakar, I., Adi Narayana, S., Anilprakash, M., Condition monitoring of a 3-O induction motor by vibration spectrum anaylsis using Fft analyser-A case study (2017) Mater.

The capacitive sensors can meet stringent privacy, power, cost, and unobtrusiveness requirements, they do not rely on wearables or specific human interactions, but they may need significant on-board data processing to increase their performance. We comparatively analyze in terms of overall processing time and energy several data processing implementations of multilayer perceptron neural networks (NNs) on board capacitive sensors. The NN architecture, optimized using augmented experimental data, consists of six 17-bit inputs, two hidden layers with eight neurons each, and one four-bit output. For the software (SW) NN implementation, we use two STMicroelectronics STM32 low-power ARM microcontrollers (MCUs): one MCU optimized for power and one for performance. For hardware (HW) implementations, we use four ultralow-power field-programmable gate arrays (FPGAs), with different sizes, dedicated computation blocks, and data communication interfaces (one FPGA from the Lattice iCE40 family and three FPGAs from the Microsemi IGLOO family). Our shortest SW implementation latency is 54.4 µs and the lowest energy per inference is 990 nJ, while the shortest HW implementation latency is 1.99 µs and the lowest energy is 39 nJ (including the data transfer between MCU and FPGA). The FPGAs active power ranges between 6.24 and 34.7 mW, while their static power is between 79 and 277 µW. They compare very favorably with the static power consumption of Xilinx and Altera low-power device families, which is around 40 mW. The experimental results show that NN inferences offloaded to external FPGAs have lower latency and energy than SW ones (even when using HW multipliers), and the FPGAs with dedicated computational blocks (multiply-accumulate) perform best. © 2019 Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc..

Our mixed-model HSPICE simulation results have shown that, for a well-known pattern recognition task, a 34-neuron S-ANN implementation achieves more than 1.5 orders of magnitude lower energy consumption and 2.5 orders of magnitude less hidden layer chip area, when compared with its deterministic-based ANN counterparts which are implemented with digital and analog CMOS circuits. We believe that our S-ANN architecture achieves such a remarkable performance gain by leveraging two key ideas. First, because all neural signals are encoded as random bit streams, the standard weighted-sum synapses can be accomplished by stochastic bit writing and reading procedure. Second, we designed and implemented a novel multiple-phase pumping circuit structure to effectively realize the soft-limiting neural transfer function that is essential to improve the overall ANN capability and reduce its network complexity. © 2015 IEEE.","artificial neural network; domain wall motion; Magnetic tunneling junction; soft-limiting neuron; stochastic computing","Computer architecture; Computer hardware; Domain walls; Energy utilization; Magnetic devices; Network architecture; Neural networks; Neurons; Pattern recognition; Random processes; SPICE; Stochastic systems; Transfer functions; Analog CMOS circuit; Biological neural networks; Computing architecture; Domain wall motion; Magnetic tunneling junctions; Neural transfer functions; Orders of magnitude; Stochastic computing; Low power electronics",,,,,,,,"Fan, D., Sharad, M., Sengupta, A., Roy, K., Hierarchical temporal memory based on spin-neurons and resistive memory for energy-efficient brain-inspired computing (2016) IEEE Trans.

However, it can take a long time for DNNs to make an inference on resource-limited embedded devices. Offloading the computation into the cloud is often infeasible due to privacy concerns, high latency, or the lack of connectivity. As such, there is a critical need to find a way to effectively execute the DNN models locally on the devices. This paper presents an adaptive scheme to determine which DNN model to use for a given input, by considering the desired accuracy and inference time. Our approach employs machine learning to develop a predictive model to quickly select a pre-trained DNN to use for a given input and the optimization constraint. We achieve this by first training off-line a predictive model, and then use the learnt model to select a DNN model to use for new, unseen inputs. We apply our approach to the image classification task and evaluate it on a Jetson TX2 embedded deep learning platform using the ImageNet ILSVRC 2012 validation dataset. We consider a range of influential DNN models. Experimental results show that our approach achieves a 7.52% improvement in inference accuracy, and a 1.8x reduction in inference time over the most-capable single DNN model. © 2018 ACM.","Adaptive computing; Deep learning; Embedded systems","Classification (of information); Embedded systems; Learning systems; Adaptive scheme; Embedded device; Learning models; Learning network; Learning platform; Predictive modeling; Privacy concerns; Deep learning",,,,,"Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council, EPSRC: EP/M01567X/1, EP/M015734/1, EP/M015793/1","This work was partly supported by the UK EPSRC under grants EP/M015734/1 (Dionasys), EP/M01567X/1 (SANDeRs), and EP/M015793/1 (DIVIDEND).",,"Allaire, J.J., Eddelbuettel, D., Golding, N., Tang, Y., (2016) TensorFlow for R, , https://tensorflow.rstudio.com/; Amodei, D., Deep speech 2: End-to-end speech recognition in english and Mandarin (2016) ICML '16; Bahdanau, D., (2014) Neural Machine Translation by Jointly Learning to Align and Translate, , 2014; Bhattacharya, S., Lane, N.D., Sparsification and separation of deep learning layers for constrained resource inference on wearables (2016) Conference on Embedded Networked Sensor Systems; Canziani, A., Paszke, A., Culurciello, E., An analysis of deep neural network models for practical applications (2016) CoRR, , (2016); Chen, S., Adaptive optimization of sparse matrix-vector multiplication on emerging many-core architectures (2018) HPCC '18; Chen, W., Compressing neural networks with the hashing trick (2015) ICML '16; Cho, K., Learning phrase representations using RNN encoder-decoder for statistical machine translation (2014) EMNLP '14; Cummins, C., End-to-end deep learning of optimization heuristics (2017) PACT '17; Delimitrou, C., Kozyrakis, C., Quasar: Resourceefficient and qos-aware cluster management (2014) ASPLOS '14; Donahue, J., Decaf: A deep convolutional activation feature for generic visual recognition (2014) ICML '14; Krishna Emani, M., Smart, adaptive mapping of parallelism in the presence of external workload (2013) CGO '13; Krishna Emani, M., O'Boyle, M., Celebrating diversity: A mixture of experts approach for runtime mapping in dynamic environments (2015) PLDI '15; Georgiev, P., Low-resource multi-task audio sensing for mobile and embedded devices via shared deep neural network representations (2017) ACM Interact.

Embedded software testing tools are useful for catching defects during unit, integration and system test-ing. Embedded systems in many cases must be optimized by engaging crucial areas of the embedded systems considering all factors of the input domain. The most important concern is to build a place of test cases depend on design of the requirements that can recognize more number of faults at a least rate and point in time in the major sections of an embedded system. This paper proposes a Neural Net-work Based strategy (NNBS) to generate optimized test cases based on the considerations of the system. A tool called NNTCG (Neural Network Test Case Generator) has been build up based on the method proposed in this paper. Test cases are generated for testing an em-bedded system using NNTCG and the same are used to determine the expected output through the neural network and the output gener-ated from the actual firmware. The faulty paths within the firmware are determined when the output generated by the neural network is not same as the output generated by the firmware. © 2018 Authors.","Automated test case generation;

Testing of the embedded systems is crucial as the user rejects the buggy systems very fast. Test cases are required that deal with the relationships among the input-output domains. A combinatorial method that considers both the inputs and the relationships that exists between the inputs and outputs for generating the test cases has been developed. Using the method test cases are generated that are good enough to carry exhaustive testing using different methods. Neural network are good learning models that relate the inputs to outputs and the hidden computing nodes relate to the computing relationships among the inputs and outputs. In this paper An neural network based test case generation method that considers the input-output domain has been presented. The NN model has been used for verifying the equivalence of output generated from NN model and the actual firmware which can be used as a kind of verification method. The approach has been used for testing an embedded system that monitors and controls the temperatures within the Nuclear reactor systems. © 2018, Institute of Advanced Scientific Research, Inc.

The system comprises two chips: an always-on functional CMOS image sensor (CIS) for imaging and face detection (FD) and a low-power CNN processor (CNNP) for face verification (FV). A functional CIS integrated with an FD accelerator enables event-driven chip-to-chip communication for face images only when there is a face. To achieve low power consumption in FD while maintaining the memory size required for the FD processing not to exceed the on-chip memory size, the authors present two-stage FD using an analog FD unit and a digital FD unit. For the event-driven FV, the CNNP adopts dynamic voltage and frequency scaling to minimize the power consumption when the number of faces in input images changes dynamically. In addition, tensor decomposition is used to reduce a CNN's workload, and the CNNP architecture based on transpose-read SRAM (T-SRAM) allows low power consumption by reducing the local memory access. Implemented in 65-nm CMOS technology, the 3.30 3.36 mmsup2/sup functional CIS and the 4 4 mmsup2/sup CNNP consume 0.62 mW to evaluate one face at 1 frame per second and achieve 97 percent accuracy in the LFW dataset. © 1981-2012 IEEE.","application-based system; authentication; face recognition; image processing and computer vision; low-power design; neural nets; special-purpose system","Authentication; CMOS integrated circuits; Convolution; Dynamic frequency scaling; Electric power supplies to apparatus; Electric power utilization; Finite difference method; Image processing; Low power electronics; Memory architecture; Neural networks; Semiconductor devices; Static random access storage; Voltage scaling; Chip-to-chip communications; Convolutional neural network; Dynamic voltage and frequency scaling; Face recognition systems; Image processing and computer vision; Low-power consumption; Low-power design; special-purpose system; Face recognition",,,,,"Ministry of Science, ICT and Future Planning, MSIP: 2016-0-00207; Institute for Information and Communications Technology Promotion, IITP","This work was supported by an Institute for Information & Communications Technology Promotion (IITP) grant funded by the Korean government (MSIP) (no. 2016-0-00207).",,"Evans, D., (2011) The Internet of Things: How the Next Evolution of the Internet Is Changing Everything, , white paper, Cisco IBSG, Apr; Andrews, G., Przywara, L., (2015) Keeping Always-on Systems on for Low-Energy Internet-of-Things Applications, , report, Cadence Design Systems; Bong, K., A 0.62mw ultra-low-power convolutional-neural-network face-recognition processor and a cis integrated with always-on haar-like face detector (2017) Proc.

In designing the image recognition system, the traditional convolutional neural network has some defects such as long training time, easy over-fitting and high misclassification rate. In order to overcome these defects, we firstly used the immune mechanism to improve the convolutional neural network and put forward a novel immune convolutional neural network algorithm, after we analyzed the network structure and parameters of the convolutional neural network. Our algorithm not only integrated the location data of the network nodes and the adjustable parameters, but also dynamically adjusted the smoothing factor of the basis function. In addition, we utilized the NVIDIA GPU (Graphics Processing Unit) to accelerate the new immune convolutional neural network (ICNN) in parallel computing and built a real-time embedded image recognition system for this ICNN. The immune convolutional neural network algorithm was improved with CUDA programming and was tested with the sample data in the GPU-based environment. The GPU-based implementation of the novel immune convolutional neural network algorithm was made with the cuDNN, which was designed by NVIDIA for GPU-based accelerating of DNNs in machine learning. Experimental results show that our new immune convolutional neural network has higher recognition rate, more stable performance and faster computing speed than the traditional convolutional neural network. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd","Convolutional neural network; Embedded system; Image recognition; Immune algorithm; Parallel computing; Security monitoring","Artificial intelligence; Computer graphics; Computer graphics equipment; Defects; Embedded systems; Image recognition; Learning systems; Neural networks; Optimization; Parallel processing systems; Parameter estimation; Program processors; Space research; Adjustable parameters; Convolutional neural network; Graphics Processing Unit; Image recognition system; Immune algorithms; Intelligent monitoring; Misclassification rates; Security monitoring; Convolution",,,,,"X12071306; Natural Science Foundation of Shanghai: 13ZR1400200; National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC: 61271114, 61673007; Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities","This work was supported by the grants from National Natural Science Foundation of China ( 61673007 , 61271114 ), Natural Science Foundation of Shanghai ( 13ZR1400200 ), Key Reform Project in Shanghai University Undergraduate Education ( X12071306 ) and the Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities at Donghua Univ .
